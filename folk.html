          Vietnamese folk music is extremely diverse and includes dân ca, quan họ,
          hát tuồng, hát chầu văn, ca trù, hò, hát xẩm, hát xoan, bài chòi, đờn ca
          tài tử, ca Huế and trống quân, among other forms.
  
          <h3>Chèo</h3>
          <p>
            Chèo is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, often
            encompassing dance, traditionally performed by peasants in northern
            Vietnam. It is usually performed outdoors by semi-amateur touring
            groups, stereotypically in a village square or the courtyard of a public
            building, although today it is also increasingly performed indoors and
            by professional performers.
          </p>
          <h3>Xẩm</h3>
          <p>
            Xẩm or Hát xẩm (Xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music which
            was popular in the Northern region of Vietnam but is considered nowadays
            an endangered form of traditional music in Vietnam. In the dynastic
            time, xẩm was performed by blind artists who wandered from town to town
            and earned their living by singing in common places.
          </p>
          <h3>Quan họ</h3>
  
          <p>
            Quan họ (alternate singing) is popular in Hà Bắc (divided into nowadays
            Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam; numerous
            variations exist, especially in the Northern provinces. Sung a cappella,
            quan họ is improvised and is used in courtship rituals.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Hát chầu văn</h3>
          <p>
            Hát chầu văn or hát văn is a spiritual form of music used to invoke
            spirits during ceremonies. It is highly rhythmic and trance-oriented.
            Before 1986, the Vietnamese government repressed hát chầu văn and other
            forms of religious expression. It has since been revived by musicians
            like Phạm Văn Tỵ.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Ca trù</h3>
  
          <p>
            Ca trù (also hát cô đầu) is a popular folk music which is said to have
            begun with ca nương, a female singer who charmed the enemy with her
            voice. Most singers remain female, and the genre has been revived since
            the Communist government loosened its repression in the 1980s, when it
            was associated with prostitution. Ca trù, which has many forms, is
            thought to have originated in the imperial palace, eventually moving
            predominantly into performances at communal houses for scholars and
            other members of the elite (this is the type of ca trù most widely
            known). It can be referred to as a Korean gisaeng-type of entertainment
            where women, trained in music and poetry, entertained rich and powerful
            men.
