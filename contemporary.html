      <h1>Contemporary Music</h1>
      <h3>V-pop</h3>
      <p>
        The embrace of modern pop music culture has increased, as each new
        generation of people in Vietnam has become more exposed to and
        influenced by westernized music along with the fashion styles of Hong
        Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musical production has improved and expanded over the years as visiting
        performers and organizers from other countries have helped to stimulate
        the Vietnamese entertainment industry. Such performances include
        international stages like the Asia Music Festival in South Korea where
        popular Vietnamese singers such as Mỹ Linh, Mỹ Tâm, Hồ Ngọc Hà, Lam
        Trường, Sơn Tùng M-TP and others have performed along with other singers
        from different Asian countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the recent years such as 2006 and beyond, Vietnamese pop music
        has tremendously improved from years past. Vietnamese music has been
        able to widen its reach to audiences nationally and also overseas. There
        are many famous underground artists such as Andree Right Hand, Big
        Daddy, Shadow P (all featured in a popular song called Để anh được yêu)
        or Lil' Knight and countless others who have risen to fame through the
        Internet. In addition, there are also other singers that have gone
        mainstream such as M4U, Hồ Ngọc Hà, Bảo Thy, Wanbi Tuấn Anh, Khổng Tú
        Quỳnh, Radio Band, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are also amateur singers whose songs have been hits in Vietnam
        such as Khởi My, Tóc Tiên, Văn Mai Hương,... These singers tend to view
        singing as a hobby, therefore not being labeled as mainstream artists.
        Overall, the quality of recording and the style of music videos in
        Vietnam has improved a lot compared to the past years due to many
        private productions and also overseas Vietnamese coming back to produce
        a combination of Western and Vietnamese music.
      </p>
      <p>
        With passing time and upcoming generations in the music industry, even
        Vietnam has picked up a lot of trends from the international (western
        mainly) music. Countries like Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and China have
        also influenced Vietnamese music. With their singers like Hồ Quỳnh
        Hương, Mỹ Tâm, Hồ Ngọc Hà, Lam Trường, and many more performing on
        international stages, the Vietnamese music industry is at a booming
        high. In the last decade or so there has been a substantial grown in
        Vietnamese pop music. There have been a lot of mainstream, independent
        and labelled artists coming up in Vietnam in recent times. This also has
        succeeded in raising the bars for the quality of recording and editing
        of songs and their music videos. More and more private music recording
        studios are blooming in Vietnam. This has helped a lot of Vietnamese
        singers to collaborate with international stars.

      <h3>Rock and Heavy Metal</h3>

      <p>
        Introduced by American soldiers, rock and roll was popular in Saigon
        during the Vietnam War. This genre has developed strongly in the South
        and has spread out over the North region after the rise of Bức Tường in
        the 90s. For the last 10 years, metal has become more mainstream in
        Vietnam. Ngũ Cung and Microwave are the current top Vietnamese metal
        bands in the 21st century.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the Vietnam War, the Americans brought with them the rock and
        roll style. This spread after the warlike wildfire and began growing
        until it became mainstream in most of the regions. So yes, for the past
        decade or so, Vietnam has even generated the Rock and Heavy Metal music
        culture, their current top bands being Buc Tuong Microwave and the Black
        Infinity
      </p>
      .

      <p>
        Although the current generation is heavily inspired by contemporary
        music in Vietnam, traditional music there will always have a sense of
        intrigue to them and warmth to the older generations. The last decade
        has been really experimental and evolving in the Vietnamese music
        industry but this hasn't brought it down at any point of time. Instead,
        their love for their folk music forms has just kept growing and it
        remains one of the major tourist attractions till date.
